   <h1>Foward-Facing Car Seats</h1>
   <p> 
       There are three types of foward-facing car seats:
       <ul>
           <li><span>Convertible Car Seat</span>: can be installed in a rear-facing or foward-facing position and encourages keeping a child in the rear-facing position a little longer since it tends to accomodate multiple stages.</li><br>

           <li><span>Combination Car Seat</span>: can transition from a forward-facing seat, that includes a harness and tether into a booster eat.</li><br>
           
           <li><span>All-in-one Seat</span>: accomondates rear-facing, foward-facing and booster-style stages. Booster-style seats are described on the <a href="booster.html">Booster Seat page.</li><br>
        </ul>
        All car seats manual should be checked for the individual manufacturer's guidlines.
